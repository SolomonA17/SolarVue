# SolarVue: Explore the Planets of Our Solar System

## Introduction

SolarVue is a web application designed to help users explore the planets of our solar system and their moons. The project was inspired by the desire to make space exploration more interactive and accessible. Through SolarVue, users can learn detailed information about each planet, its characteristics, and the celestial bodies that orbit them.

## Project Story

Growing up, I have always been fascinated by the planets and stars, and SolarVue is a product of that fascination. The sheer scale of our solar system, the diversity of the planets, and the beauty of their moons are just a few reasons why I embarked on this project. SolarVue is designed to be an interactive tool that provides detailed and engaging content about each planet in our solar system.

## Technical Details

### Frontend

The frontend of SolarVue is built using HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), and JavaScript. SCSS was implemented for more control over styling and to make the interface more dynamic and responsive.

### Key Features:

- **Interactive Interface**: Users can click on each planet to learn about its size, atmosphere, moons, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: SolarVue is designed to work across devices, offering an optimized view for both desktop and mobile users.

## Future Enhancements

In future iterations, I plan to add the following features to SolarVue:

• **3D Planet Viewer**: Users can rotate and zoom in on planets to view them in more detail.

• **Planet Comparisons**: Provide users with the ability to compare planets side by side based on different characteristics (size, distance from the sun, atmosphere).

• **User Profiles**: Allow users to save their favorite planets and personalize their experience.

## Learnings

Working on SolarVue has been an exciting journey. I learned more about SCSS and HAML, and gained deeper insight into responsive web design and frontend development. One of the key takeaways from this project has been learning how to present complex data in a user-friendly and engaging way.

If I were to start over, I would focus more on optimizing performance for larger datasets, especially when handling the detailed moon information for each planet.

Thank you for exploring SolarVue. I hope it inspires curiosity about the vastness of our solar system!
